## Demo Site
This is still a Work in progress and buggy, but a site to test it out has been setup:
<br/>
Create/modify/update profile: https://nostree-87f2c.web.app/manage
<br/>
View a profile: https://nostree-87f2c.web.app/?npub=SOME-NPUB

Notes:
* Right now a default list of relay connections is established. This can be overridden by a `relays` url argument that consists of a comma separated list of relays.
    * Example: `?relays=wss://relay.damus.io,wss://relay.snort.social`
    * dynamic relay management is being worked on
